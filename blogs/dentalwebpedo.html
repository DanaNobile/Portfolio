        <h3>Preventative Dental Care for Kids</h3>
        <p>Regular oral care is not only important in maintaining a healthy smile but also to your child’s overall
            health. At Rising Stars Pediatric Dentistry & Orthodontics, we understand that good oral hygiene is an
            ongoing commitment and we are dedicated to supporting your child in all of their dental needs with our
            leading pediatric dentistry team. We deliver prenatal and perinatal counseling, cleanings, exams, fluoride,
            silver diamine fluoride and sealants. By providing you with trusted information about preventative care, our
            team aims to empower your child to take control of their oral health and establish their dental home.
            Routine cleanings are a large part of developing good oral hygiene as they provide our dental team with the
            opportunity to examine your oral health and address growth issues or emerging infection in the early stages.
            Our team will work with you to develop recommendations for a care plan based on your child’s unique needs.
            Call us today to schedule a cleaning and exam with our team!</p>

        <h3>Restorative Dentistry</h3>
        <p>Restorative dentistry is a specific branch of dentistry focused on restoring the health and function of your
            child’s smile following tooth damage, tooth decay or tooth loss. At Rising Stars Pediatric Dentistry &
            Orthodontics, our caring staff offers a wide array of restorative dental treatments to meet the individual
            dental needs of each child including white fillings, root canal treatment and crowns for primary teeth.
            After a comprehensive examination, our highly skilled dental team will work with you to develop a treatment
            plan that is tailored to your child’s unique oral health goals as well as your budget and preferences. We
            can help your child feel confident in the look and feel of their smile. Call to schedule a consultation with
            our team today!</p>

        <h3>Laser Dentistry</h3>
        <p>For many young patients, going to the dentist can be daunting. For this reason, we work incredibly hard to
            develop trust with our patients and rely on advanced technology to ensure their restorative treatments are
            comfortable and natural looking. An alternative to virtually painless procedures is laser dentistry. These
            powerful dental lasers replace the dental drill in the majority of procedures in our practice. They cause
            virtually no pain, vibration or noise. In fact, with laser dentistry, anesthesia is rarely needed.</p>

        <h3>Surgical Services</h3>
        <p>If the word "surgery" causes anxiety in you, don't worry. At Rising Stars Pediatric Dentistry & Orthodontics,
            our goal is to reduce anxiety with a gentle touch, an empathetic demeanor and advanced training in sedation
            anesthesia. We are committed to giving our patients the most comfortable, professional and timely experience
            possible. Our dental surgery specialists provide everything from routine treatments, such as teeth
            extractions, to more complicated treatments, such as soft tissue surgical procedures. There are few dentists
            more qualified to expertly handle your child’s oral surgical needs than those of Rising Stars Pediatric
            Dentistry & Orthodontics. Contact our office today to schedule an appointment!</p>

        <h3>Habit Breakers</h3>
        <p>If your child has a dysfunctional habit, such as thumb sucking or placing the tongue in between their front
            teeth, our team can evaluate and implement habit breakers. We can also provide a space maintainer to ensure
            your child’s primary teeth develop properly.</p>

        <h3>Management of Traumatic Injuries</h3>
        <p>Traumatic mouth and teeth injuries can be painful and frightening to both the child and parent. Rest assured
            our team will handle these injuries in a safe, efficient and compassionate manner. Call our office to
            schedule immediate treatment.</p>

        <h3>Special Care for Special Children</h3>
        <p>If you’re the parent of a child with disabilities, you’ll appreciate the support, skill and compassion you
            will find from our doctors. We are a premier pediatric dental practice in the Lakeline area that specializes
            in treating special needs children. No matter what your child’s disability, we can handle every aspect of
            their dental care. We can help put your child on the path to a lifetime of good oral health with a care plan
            customized to fit their needs.</p>
