        <p>Social media is an excellent way to connect with your audience on a daily basis. Think of these pages as
            living, breathing mini-websites that continuously position your firm as current and relatable.</p>

        <p>There are several ways law firms can benefit from social media marketing, such as generating brand awareness,
            attracting prospective clients, and having the ability to target your ideal audience. Not to mention, active
            social media pages also <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.postali.com/what-we-do/law-firm-seo/"
                target="_blank">improve
                your SEO</a>, and
            position your attorneys as thought leaders in your practice area.</p>

        <p>However, with the demands of running a successful firm, handling cases, and managing employees, how do you
            find the time to grow your social network? These 10 quick tips will help you find your mojo, and lay the
            foundation for a successful social media marketing strategy for your law firm.</p>

        <h3>1. Start by listening</h3>
        <p>Before jumping in head first, take some time to explore what people are saying about your firm. Search for
            your practice name on places like <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>, <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, <a id="blog-link" href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, and <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>. What type of results are rendered? You may
            discover a page for
            your business you didn’t know existed, or come across a string of comments mentioning your firm. Your
            discoveries will allow you to understand your existing presence and how to improve.</p>

        <h3>2. Choose the right platform</h3>
        <p>The most optimal social media channel may vary depending on your area of practice. The audience on Twitter,
            for example, may not match that of LinkedIn. Your content on each platform should be customized to reflect
            this. Create a list of keywords pertaining to your firm’s services, and start to research which platforms
            already have conversations brewing on those topics. Determine where these applicable mentions are happening,
            and then focus on those channels. When getting started, it is wise to focus on one or two platforms, opposed
            to trying to dominate every social media outlet.</p>

        <h3>3. Be consistent</h3>
        <p>If you are Googling information and land on a page that displays dated content, chances are you are going to
            leave and continue your search for current information. The same goes for social media. If your last post is
            dated, your firm loses credible relevance in the eyes of visitors.</p>

        <p>An efficient way to stay consistent with your posting, is to draft a monthly content calendar. Outline what
            content you want to feature, and when it will be deployed. This will give you a quick reference on what to
            post, so you aren’t scrambling last minute.</p>

        <h3>4. Record and share videos</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have a <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>
            account, it is a quick and easy process to <a id="blog-link"
                href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861?hl=en" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">set one up</a>. Use this channel to host informational videos,
            and then share them on your appropriate social media channels. According to <a id="blog-link"
                href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/video-marketing-statistics-for-2020-infographic/566099/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Social Media Today</a>, 78% of people watch videos online
            every week, and 55% of those watch every day. Use <a id="blog-link"
                href="https://www.postali.com/what-we-do/video-photo-production/" target="_blank">professional
                videos</a> to share
            updates about your firm, answer FAQs, communicate changes to the law, and showcase the culture of your firm.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Promote your blog</h3>
        <p>Blogging is an excellent way to provide long-form value that answers your prospective clients’ pressing
            questions. In the legal industry, it is imperative that you showcase your experience and expertise in your
            practice area. Consumers want to see that you are an active part of the legal community, and a competent
            source to manage their case.</p>

        <p>In addition to valuable content for social media, blogging also improves your SEO efforts, and provides a
            place to direct your social media traffic.</p>

        <h3>6. Post informative graphics</h3>
        <p>Social media is visual. <a id="blog-link"
                href="https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/16-visual-content-marketing-statistics-that-will-wake-you-up-59c4c0b80465"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MobileMonkey</a> discovered that posts with images
            produced 650% higher engagement than text-only ones. You may have amazing statistics to share, but simply
            typing and posting them will not attract the attention those numbers deserve.</p>

        <p>Creative tools, such as <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Canva</a>, offer free templates that you can quickly adapt to reflect your
            firm’s brand. These visual posts don’t have to be solely numerical stats, you can generate content such as
            “Legal Tip Tuesday,” or share other legal updates in a creative way.</p>

        <h3>7. Use the 80/20 rule</h3>
        <p>As you know, promotions are not what is going to land a client- your successful track-record is the incentive
            you have to offer. Therefore, 80% of your content should provide value (such as the aforementioned blogs and
            videos), and only 20% should have a sales connotation. It’s perfectly acceptable to remind and encourage
            your followers to book a free consultation, but if this all your feed is producing, you will quickly see a
            decline in engagement.</p>

        <h3>8. Make it personal</h3>
        <p>Not only is social media a great way for you to connect with your clients, it is a positive avenue to
            showcase your exemplary team. People like to see who is making the magic happen behind the scenes of a
            company. Post photos of your team members attending a legal conference, participating in a community event,
            or even celebrating birthdays and anniversaries in the office. Social media can easily become a window to
            your firm’s values, culture and people.</p>

        <h3>9. Engage with your audience</h3>
        <p>Like most communication, social media is a two-way street. Responding to audience questions and comments is a
            must. This engagement shows your followers that you are accessible and there to help.</p>

        <p>While there are shortcuts, such as simply “liking” someone’s comment, take it a step further and craft a
            sincere response. If that sounds overwhelming, social media marketing tools such as <a id="blog-link"
                href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hootsuite</a> and <a
                id="blog-link" href="https://sproutsocial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sprout
                Social</a> help
            streamline this process by allowing you to interact with multiple platforms from one place.</p>

        <p>Remember to also use social media to connect with referral sources and colleagues in the industry. Like,
            share and engage with their content to start building a strong social network.</p>

        <h3>10. Invest in paid ads</h3>
        <p>One of the key benefits of social media <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.postali.com/what-we-do/ppc/"
                target="_blank">paid
                advertising</a> is the ability to finitely target your audience. Users provide an abundance of data
            in their profiles, allowing you to reach individuals who are most likely to convert. Repurpose the content
            you are using for daily posts, and turn them into targeted ads.</p>

        <p>Each platform has a unique set of benefits and ad capabilities. Start with a broad message and audience, and
            use the applicable insights to determine where your efforts are most successful.</p>

        <p>There are an abundance of ways your firm can benefit from social media marketing. Keep in mind that it takes
            time to build your brand awareness and adopt a tribe of followers, so don’t get discouraged if results
            aren’t immediate. These tips, however, will get you started in the right direction and set you up for
            success. If you need assistance with your firm’s social media marketing strategy, <a id="blog-link"
