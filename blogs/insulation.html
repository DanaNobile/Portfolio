        <p>With so many roof installation options, we are here to help you make the right decision. Certified Green
            Material Icynene has much to offer. Traditional insulation materials such as Fiberglass and Cellulose have
            an insulation R Value (a measure of resistance to heat flow through a given thickness of material) of R-30.
            Icynene offers an R Value of R-13, providing better circulation and air sealing properties.
        </p>


        <p>In the average home, there are many areas from which air can escape, including windows, doors, garages and
            more. Icynene spray foam provides both insulation and air sealing in one step! This keeps your home running
            comfortably and efficiently all year long, no matter the exterior temperature. Whether the goal is to keep
            cool air or heat in the home, you can rest assured your desired temperature will be reached and sustained.
        </p>


        <p>Utility bills will reflect tremendous savings as there is less opportunity for appliances to work in
            overdrive to keep circulation and temperature controls running optimally. Icynene Spray Foam Installation
            expands up to 100 times its size to fill each gap and crack in the home. Heating or cooling bills will
            significantly drop as appliances can run more efficiently.</p>


        <p>Another bonus of Icynene Foam Installation is that it can also minimize allergens and pollutants in the air.
            Homeowners can breathe easier and live healthier thanks to the strong barricade provided by this superior
            installation. Icynene is a proven insulation that enhances the comfort of your living environment and is the
            insulation of choice for high profile projects such as the <a id="blog-link" href="https://www.lung.org/"
