            <h3>Front</h3>
            <p>Dr. Zehra Zaid was born in Manchester, England, but considers herself a proud Texan as she grew up in
                Sugar Land, Texas. She started her college career at 16 where she attended the Texas Academy of Math and
                Science at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. She then went on to the University of Texas
                at Austin, graduating Summa Cum Laude in 2011 while majoring in Sociology and minoring in Biology. Dr.
                Zaid spent 2012 as a math and science teacher at Sugar Land Preparatory Academy. When considering dental
                schools, Dr. Zaid wanted to devote her time to helping underserved populations and accepted admission
                into the University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry where she received her Doctor of Dental Surgery
                degree in 2016. </p>


            <p>During her time in dental school, Dr. Zaid held numerous leadership roles, participated in many outreach
                projects which included extensive interaction with patients with special healthcare needs, and was a
                biomedical sciences tutor to dental students. She was the 2014 recipient of the Demler H. Eichler
                Scholarship, 2015 fellow for the Academic Dental Careers Fellowship Program, and the 2016 recipient of
                the Clinical Pediatric Dentistry Award; all while spending 4 years on the Dean’s List. </p>

            <h3>Back</h3>
            <p>With her passion for working with children, Dr. Zaid went on to complete a Master of Science in Pediatric
                Dentistry at the University of Michigan in 2018 (currently ranked as the number one dental school in the
                country, and number three in the world). Dr. Zaid’s master’s thesis explored Silver Diamine Fluoride and
                it’s use as a caries arresting material in baby teeth. </p>


            <p>After seven memorable years in Michigan, Dr. Zaid returned to her homestate to be closer to her friends
                and family. Dr. Zaid believes that every child deserves the opportunity to have a smile on the surface
                that matches the beauty of a smile within. She has a strong passion to educate, relieve discomfort, and
                gain trust in every patient. She looks forward to meeting you and your young ones soon! </p>
