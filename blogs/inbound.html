        <p>In a constant-evolving industry, experts in the field have made strides to move away from gorilla or outbound
            marketing (think Kirby vacuum sales guy at your front door) to building relationships with consumers through
            valuable content.
        </p>


        <p>Creating an Inbound Marketing strategy may seem overwhelming at first, but this post will provide five key
            elements which are easy to implement and will provide a foundation to a thriving inbound campaign.</p>


        <p>While we live in a need-it-now society, it’s important to understand a successful inbound marketing campaign
            takes time. The idea is to position your brand or product as an industry leader and to build the trust of
            consumers over time, so that when they are ready to purchase- you are on the forefront of their minds.</p>


        <p>As Chris Brogan, New York Times bestselling author and business advisor said, “Marketers need to build
            digital relationships and reputation before closing a sale.”
        </p>

        <p>In other words, don’t say I love you on the first date, don’t buy the first house your tour, and don’t ask
            consumers to commit to your product before understanding your business. </p>

        <h3>Part #1 Know Thy Self & Know Thy Audience</h3>


        <p>You can’t possibly create any type of strategy without a solid understanding of your core business and
            values, and who you serve. I recommend working with other members outside of the marketing team- your CEO,
            sales managers and other company leaders- to get a full scope of The Why. Why did the business open? Why do
            they offer the product or service that they do? Why did the Mission Statement come to be? Why choose this
            business over competitors? </p>
        <p>Once you’ve answered those questions, you can start to build your Buyer Persona(s). This is a fictional
            character that outlines the typical customer you are serving, with a focus on their pain points and how your
            business solves them. A Buyer Persona should include demographic details, interests, income, profession,
            buying patterns, and their goals. A great way to find this information? Talk to your existing customers!
            Surveys and questionnaires are an invaluable way to gain insight into those who have already converted, and
            how to attract more of the like. Using a CRM system, such as HubSpot, will allow you to identify patterns
            and eventually segment lists according to those patterns.</p>



        <h3>Part #2 Define Your Goals</h3>
        <p>Without a clearly defined goal, there’s no way to measure success. While most companies share a similar
            universal goal- increase revenue- you’ll have to be more acute. Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
            Relevant, Timely) goals that outline exactly what the marketing team is setting out to do.
        </p>
        <p>For example: I want to increase blog subscribers by 15% over the duration of two months with a social media
            strategy using Facebook and Instagram as prime channels for conversion. </p>

        <p>With a focus here on blog and social media content, this allows your team to narrow their focus and then
            measure results. </p>

        <h3>Part #3 Build the Roadmap </h3>
        <p>Now that you understand what you have to offer, who is in the market for that offer, and what the goals are-
            you can start to navigate consumers along your map. </p>
        <p>Typically, an incentive or offer is what the roadmap is built around. Your amazing content team can create
            assets that support this campaign and educate your consumers. This is an excellent opportunity to introduce
            content such as white papers, ebooks, checklists, video tutorials, etc. </p>
        <p>This asset you create however, is not free. It doesn’t cost your consumer anything in a monetary value, but
            it will require them to exchange their information for your valuable piece of work. I suggest starting with
            the basics- name and email- and using a trackable form for submissions. </p>
        <p>This is where your conversion path comes into play. In order to effectively capture your leads, you will want
            to implement that here: Call to Action -> Landing Page -> Thank You Page</p>
        <p>As you unveiled your buyer persona, this speaks to where your content will be most successful. For example,
            if you are targeting millennials, perhaps Instagram is your best source, if B2B- check out options on
            LinkedIn. </p>
        <p>Let’s use the B2B LinkedIn example.</p>
        <p>Call To Action (CTA): Paid or organic post on LinkedIn: Download this Infographic to see why investing in the
            growth of your employees increases your bottom line.

        </p>
        <p>Landing Page: Hopefully your LinkedIn post intrigued your user and he/she visits landing page where they are
            asked to submit their email and name to download the aforementioned Infographic.</p>
        <p>Thank You Page: Once the CTA is complete and form is submitted, the user will then be directed to a Thank You
            page. The goal of this page is to keep your lead interested. You may feature supportive information on the
            topic at hand such as a blog post, short video, and snapshot statistics on the subject. </p>



        <h3>Part #4 Nurture Your Leads</h3>
        <p>Now that you have the user’s data and connected it to your CRM database- it’s time to use email automation to
            nurture this lead. Start with a Thank You Email that clearly states why they are receiving the email and
            introduce another valuable asset to keep the lead engaged.</p>
        <p>Emaple: Thanks for downloading our Infographic- we thought you might want to check out this video on the top
            five leadership building techniques you can implement today!</p>
        <p>Depending on the path this lead takes, you can start to send periodic emails which offer further value based
            on their actions. Case studies, blogs, whitepapers are all excellent options. </p>
        <p>This is where you are starting to build a trusting relationship with your lead and prove your value. You can
            also gain insight into user behavior and which content pieces are working best for your goals. The idea here
            is to nurture your lead until they convert into a customer. </p>


        <h3>Part #5 Report and Analyze</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of your Inbound Marketing Campaign is measuring results. While marketers
            can take pride in how pretty their landing pages are and how interesting their blog post is- it means
            nothing if your leads didn’t convert.</p>
        <p>A few metrics to consider tracking are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many users converted (completed the form or took the desired action) on your landing page</li>
            <li>What was your Click Through Rate (CTR) on the nurture emails sent</li>
            <li>How many unsubscribes or opt-outs did the email campaign render</li>
            <li>Number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) the campaign produced</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The list goes on and your company may have a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI) it is tracking. Going
            back to Inbound Marketing Strategy Part #2 Define Your Goals- your metrics should reflect the performance of
            what your team initially set out to do. </p>
        <p>Great tools for measuring analytics include:</p>


        <ul>
            <li><a id="blog-link" href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision"
                    target="_blank">Google
                    Analytics</a></li>
            <li><a id="blog-link" f="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank">Google Search
                    Console</a>
            </li>
            <li><a id="blog-link" href="https://moz.com/" target="_blank">Moz</a></li>
            <li><a id="blog-link" href="https://www.hubspot.com/ " target="_blank">HubSpot</a></li>
            <li><a id="blog-link" href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Inbound Marketing is a fun and effective way to convert your potential leads into brand-loyal customers.
            Think of your campaign as building an ambassador team that extends beyond those on your payroll. Positioning
            your brand as the go-to thought leader, trend-setter and educational source for your industry allows you to
            grow your business with a solid foundation of qualified leads for which your sales team will be eternally
            grateful.</p>
