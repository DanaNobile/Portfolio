        <h3>Traditional Braces</h3>
        <p>Orthodontic treatment provides your child with a healthy bite and beautiful smile. Our specialists are
            dedicated to the complete care of your child. Braces offer improved oral health, reduce injury to protruding
            teeth, improve coordination of jaw growth and tooth development and can improve one’s overall look and
            self-esteem. Our team offers Early Interceptive Orthodontics, treating children as early as age seven. We
            specialize in both ceramic and metal braces and will compile a treatment plan tailored to your child’s
            individual needs. As a preventative option, we also utilize Crozats which widen the jaw bone, allowing your
            child’s teeth to develop properly and reduce the total time needed in braces.</p>

        <h3>Invisible Aligners (Invisalign & Orchestrate)</h3>
        <p>The clear alternative to traditional braces! We are pleased to offer Invisalign and Invisalign Teen to our
            patients. The nearly invisible aligners are removable and allow your child to go about life with confidence,
            giving them a clear path to a beautiful smile. Invisalign uses a series of custom-made retainers called
            aligners to gradually straighten teeth. Underbites, overcrowding and gaps between teeth all can be addressed
            with Invisalign. Invisalign aligners are completely clear, smooth and removable. This means no irritation
            from metal braces, no off-limits foods and no interference with life!</p>

        <h3>Adult Treatment</h3>
        <p>We understand orthodontics may not be ideal as an adult, but by utilizing the most current and discrete
            techniques, our team can help you achieve your ideal smile at any age! A huge number of adults are taking
            the initiative to straighten their teeth and rectify existing or new oral issues. Aligners can offer a
            better bite, space out crowded teeth and close off gaps in your smile. We offer both Invisalign and
            traditional braces to our adult patients. Don’t hide your smile any longer- call us today to book an
            appointment!</p>

        <h3>Interceptive Orthodontics</h3>
        <p>Interceptive Orthodontics or Conservative Orthodontic Treatment is highly recommended for children starting
            at age 6. This orthodontic treatment utilizes growth to create an environment that promotes better arch
            development. This prepares the arches for the permanent teeth eruption and alignment at a later age while
            avoiding the need to remove any permanent teeth in the future. Our team members are experts in conservative
            orthodontic treatment of children to reduce such future problems as teeth impaction, underbite, overbite,
            crossbite and many other problems.</p>
