        <p>Despite what many people think, owning a Green Certified home in Palm Coast doesn’t mean breaking the bank.
            Our homes are affordable, elegant and actually SAVE you money. For example, our exquisite Kate Model starts
            at just $164,900, keeping the price tag economical without skimping on elegance.
        </p>


        <p>Our team pairs this home with two types of home buyers who often have similar needs and desires. The buyer
            categories include starter homes and retiree homes. The floor plan, attributes, and features meet the needs
            of those who need high functioning space, but not an abundance of square footage.</p>


        <p>The Kate is elegant and cozy with 1,350 square feet of living area and 2,007 square feet total under the
            roof. The 9’4” ceilings extend to 10’4” where our builders implement decorative trays. The split floor plan
            allows space for guests or children, while giving couples the privacy they seek. The open and bright
            interior sets a pleasant mood throughout the home and welcomes both family members and visitors alike.</p>


        <p>Entertaining is joy with the plan’s gourmet kitchen. Features include high quality wood cabinets with crown
            molding, and soft close European hardware. The stainless steel appliances offer a modern and clean
            appearance. Clean air circulates through the home and is not interrupted with the outdoor vented microwave.
        </p>

        <p>We know comfort and savings are key when building a home in Palm Coast, Florida. Our A/C systems bring fresh
            air from outside, and returns are installed in each bedroom to eliminate hot spots in the home. This
            maintains a consistent and comfortable temperature throughout the home.</p>


        <p>Did you know five independent agencies certify the quality of our homes and the benefits of owning a green
            home? Our Certified Green homes provide up to 70% in energy savings compared to traditionally built homes.
            Green homes promote a healthy indoor environment by being virtually allergen, dust and mold free. With
            upgraded ICF walls they are sound suppressant, hurricane, tornado, and fire resistant.</p>

        <p>The Kate Model is an excellent plan to start building your custom Green Certified Home. Contact our
            knowledgeable staff today to begin building your home today: 386-447-4151.
